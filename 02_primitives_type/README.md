# Primitive Data Types
- [x] Numeric  data types
    - [x] Integer
        - signed int
        -  usigned int
        - Operations 
            -  add,sum,mul,div,remider,bit shipting,bitwise operation
        - [x] zero values is 0.
- [x] don't mix the same family type(int32+int64) doesn't work
    - [x] Floating point
        - based on IEE-754 standard
        - [x] zero values is 0.
        - version 32,64
        - [x] literal style support{decimal (3.79)  exponential(18e18 0r 18E18) mixed(3.79e12))}
        - Operations 
            - add,sum,mul,div
    - [x] Complex data types
        - [x] zero values is (0+0i)
        - version 64,128
        - [x] built-in function
            - make complex numbers with two float numbers   complex(real num , imgin num)
            - get real part as float real()
            - get imaginary part as float imag()
            - Operations 
            - add,sum,mul,div
        - [x] Text types
            - [x] strings 
                - UTF8
                - collenction of bytes {byte alias of uint8}
                - immutable
            - [x] Rune
                - UTF-32
                - alias of int-32
